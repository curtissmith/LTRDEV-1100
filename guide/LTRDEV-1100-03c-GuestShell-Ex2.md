### Exercise 2: Unleashing Network Programmability at the Network Edge

#### Objectives

The objectives for this exercise are to:

* Learn how to use the CLI Python package to run IOS XE EXEC and configuration mode commands

#### Step 1: Running IOS XE Commands with the CLI Python Package

1. Cisco packages Python modules with Guest Shell that provides access to run IOS XE EXEC and configuration
commands.  The IOS XE command `ip http server` command must be enabled in configuration mode for 
these functions to work.
    
    Establish an SSH connection to the IOS XE device `csr1` by double clicking the CSR1 PuTTY icon on the desktop:
    
    ![CSR1 PuTTY Icon](assets/GuestShell-01.png)

2. From the IOS XE device CLI, ensure you are in privileged EXEC mode as indicated by the `csr1#` prompt.  If you are
in user EXEC mode as indicated by the `csr1>` prompt, then enter privileged EXEC mode with the `enable` command, for
example:
   
    ```
    csr1>enable
    csr1#
    ```
    
    ![CSR1 Privileged EXEC Mode](assets/GuestShell-02.png)

3. Enter global configuration mode, which will be indicated by the `csr1(config)#` prompt, for example:
   
    ```
    csr1#configure terminal
    Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
    csr1(config)#
    ```

4. Ensure the `ip http server` command is enabled:
    
    ```
    csr1(config)#ip http server
    csr1(config)#
    ```
    
    End the global configuration mode session with the `end` command or typing `CTRL-Z`, for example:
    
    ```
    csr1(config)#end
    csr1#
    ```

5. Enter a Guest Shell interactive session with the IOS XE command `guestshell run bash`, for example:
    
    ```
    csr1#guestshell run bash
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$

6. The CLI Python package has six functions that can execute IOS XE CLI commands.  To use these functions, use 
`import cli` in a Python script or the Python interpreter, for example, run the `python` command from the Guest Shell 
`[guestshell@guestshell ~]$` prompt:
    
    ```
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ python
    Python 2.7.5 (default, Jun 17 2014, 18:11:42)
    [GCC 4.8.2 20140120 (Red Hat 4.8.2-16)] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import cli
    >>>
    ```
    
    To execute an IOS XE CLI command from a Python script or Python interpreter, enter the CLI command as an argument 
    string to one of the following six functions:
    
    * `cli()` - This function takes an IOS XE command as an argument, runs the command through the 
    IOSparser, and returns the resulting text.  If this command is malformed, a Python exception is raised.  The 
    following is example output from a `cli()` function call:
    
        ```
        >>> cli.cli("show ip interface brief")
        '\nInterface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
         \nGigabitEthernet1       198.18.134.11   YES NVRAM  up                    up      
         \nVirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES manual up                    up      \n'
        ```
    
    * `clip()` - This function works exactly the same as the `cli()` function, except that it prints
    the resulting text to stdout rather than returning it.  The following is example output from a
    `clip()` function call:
        
        ```
        >>> cli.clip("show ip interface brief")
        
        Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
        GigabitEthernet1       198.18.134.11   YES NVRAM  up                    up
        VirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES manual up                    up
        
        >>>
        ```
    
    * `execute()` - This function executes a single IOS XE EXEC mode command and returns the resulting text.  
    You must use a Python list with a loop to execute this function more than once.  The following is example output 
    from a `execute()` function call:
        
        ```
        >>> cli.execute("show ip interface brief")
        'Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
         \nGigabitEthernet1       198.18.134.11   YES NVRAM  up                    up      
         \nVirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES manual up                    up      '
        >>>
        ```
    
    * `executep()` - This function executes a single IOS XE command and prints the resulting text to stdout
    rather than returning it.  The following is example output from a `executep()` function call:
        
        ```
        >>> cli.executep("show ip interface brief")
        Interface              IP-Address      OK? Method Status                Protocol
        GigabitEthernet1       198.18.134.11   YES NVRAM  up                    up
        Loopback55             10.55.55.55     YES TFTP   up                    up
        VirtualPortGroup0      192.168.35.1    YES manual up                    up
        >>>
        ```
    
    * `configure()` - This function configures the network device with the configuration passed to it.  It 
    returns a list of named tuples that contains each command and its result in the general format:
        
        ```
        [Think: result = (bool(success), original_command, error_information)]
        ```
        
        The following is example output from a `configure()` function call:
        
        ```
        >>> cli.configure(["interface Loopback1", "ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0", "no shutdown"])
        [ConfigResult(success=True, command='interface Loopback1', line=1, output='', notes=None),
        ConfigResult(success=True, command='ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0', line=2, output='',
        notes=None), ConfigResult(success=True, command='no shutdown', line=3, output='', notes=None)]
        >>>
        ```
    
    * `configurep()` - This function works exactly the same as the `configure()` function, except 
    that it prints the resulting text to stdout rather than returning it.  The following is example output from a
    `configurep()` function call:
        
        ```
        >>> cli.configurep(["interface Loopback1", "ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0", "no shutdown"])
        Line 1 SUCCESS: interface Loopback1
        Line 2 SUCCESS: ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
        Line 3 SUCCESS: no shutdown
        >>>
        ```
    
    You can get help and display the details of each function by using the `help()` function in the Python 
    interpreter.  For example, for help with the `configurep()` function, use a function call like
    `help(cli.configurep)` in the Python interpreter:
    
    ```
    >>> help(cli.configurep)
    Help on function configurep in module cli:
    
    configurep(configuration)
        Apply a configuration (set of Cisco IOS CLI config-mode commands) to the dev
    ice
        and prints the result.
    
        configuration = '''interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
                             no shutdown'''
    
        # push it through the Cisco IOS CLI.
        configurep(configuration)
    
        Args:
            configuration (str or iterable): Configuration commands, separated by ne
    wlines.
    
    >>>
    ```
    
    For general help with the CLI Python package itself rather than a specific function, use the `help(cli)` function
    call in the Python interpreter (output truncated for brevity):
    
    ```
    >>> help(cli)
    Help on package cli:
    
    NAME
        cli - Run Cisco IOS CLI commands and receive the output.
    
    FILE
        /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cli/__init__.py

    ```
    
    Type the `q` key to exit out of the help text at the `--More--` prompt.

7. End the Python interpreter session with the `quit()` function:
    
    ```
    >>> quit()
    [guestshell@guestshell scripts]$

    ```

8. There is an example CLI Python package Python script in this lab's Git repository.  Let's create a directory on 
the network device `bootflash:`, transfer the file to the network device file system, and run the script.

    To create a new directory to hold scripts on-box, create a new directory with the `mkdir` command and change to 
    that directory with the `cd` command from the Guest Shell `[guestshell@guestshell ~]$` prompt:
    
    ```
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ mkdir /bootflash/scripts
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$ cd /bootflash/scripts
    [guestshell@guestshell ~]$
    ```
    
    Transfer the example script with the `wget` command from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtissmith/LTRDEV-1100/labguide/code/iosxe-cli-example.py`:
    
    ```
    [guestshell@guestshell scripts]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curtissmith/LTRDEV-1100/labguide/code/iosxe-cli-example.py

    This example Python script requires a single mandatory argument: an interface name, for example `Loopback55`.  Run 
    the script with the `python` command:
    
    ```
