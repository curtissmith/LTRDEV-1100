# The Network Programmability Dojo

## What is Network Programmability

Even the most storied Ninja had to receive the training necessary to practice the methods and live the life to be 
successful.  Thank you for taking the first step with this lab at Cisco Live!

### Defining Network Programmability

Think about your own environment.  How do you manage your networks and systems?  What are the most common methods or 
tools for deploying and managing your production environment?  Text editors; tens, hundreds, maybe 
thousands of documents, drawings, and spreadsheets; CLI commands; copy-and-paste; free or commercial applications?  In
recent years, there has been an incredible increase in the number of devices on your networks; number of applications
stressing your networks; rate of change in consumer devices and applications; and pressure on network architects, 
engineers, and administrators or operators to support these demands and changes.  We tend to struggle with keeping up
with demand and make mistakes.

So-called DevOps (a compound of "Development" and "Operations") has become a popular practice of unifying development
and operations into a continuous flow of automation and monitoring throughout the stages of development, 
implementation, testing and validation, and deployment and management.  The goal is to decrease the time to cycle 
through each phase, allow for more frequent deployment, improve the quality of each deployment, and keep closely 
aligned with business priorities.  DevOps was first adopted in application and system development and deployment, and
now DevOps is turning to the network team looking for integration with the underlying network for performance 
and segmentation.

The "Cloud" isn't just a destination; it is becoming an approach to delivering IT services efficiently and 
effectively.  You should start focusing on delivering solutions rather than individual devices and feature 
configuration.  Products must adapt to facilitate automation and efficient integration rather than focusing purely on 
"nerd knobs".

Perhaps network programmability is as much an ambiguous and overused term as Software Defined Networking.  At one 
time network programmability was synonymous with OpenFlow.  Rather than getting wrapped up in semantics, let's agree 
network programmability is about driving real benefits, saving time and money, and reducing human errors.  
Network programmability is a set of tools and best practices to deploy, configure, manage, and troubleshoot network 
devices.

Vendors, including Cisco, recognizes this, and the industry is delivering solutions based on application programming 
interfaces (APIs), software development kits (SDKs), and - this is particularly true of Cisco - resources, sample 
code, training, and a community to help customers learn and put into practice new skills to apply network
programmability tools and concepts to your networks.

### Getting Started with Network Programmability

How do you get started?  Well, this very lab is a great first step!  After completing this lab, we expect you to be 
armed with the Ninja training necessary to go and practice the fine art of network programmability in your job.
