## PyCharm

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a Python integrated development environment (IDE) developed by 
[JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).  There is a
[free community version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) available for download, but you can support the 
application and obtain additional features with the purchase of the 
[professional version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/).  JetBrains describes PyCharm as 
an "intelligent coding assistant".
 
Key features of PyCharm include, but are not limited to:
 
* A smart code editor with syntax formatting, highlighting, completion and error detection
* Built-in terminal and integrated debugger
* Integrated support for version control systems, including Git
* Integrated support for Vagrant
 
An IDE like PyCharm is much more than a text editor, although it is that, too.  Let's take a look at what is key to 
getting started with PyCharm.
