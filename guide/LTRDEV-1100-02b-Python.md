## Python for Network Programmability

### Introducing Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a popular programming language and a great first language to learn. Python is 
highly readable, object oriented, and it can be run interactively through the Python interpreter. One reason that 
Python has become quite popular is due to its plethora of available packages of modules, or reusable code, to tackle 
many different projects or tasks. Additionally, Python is available for many different operating systems, some of 
which even include Python by default. This allows the same Python scripts to be written, modified, and executed by 
users on Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, Linux distributions, and more.

Learning a language like Python is really important on a journey towards network programmability. Python gives the 
flexibility to create reusable code to solve a particular problem, or perhaps automate a series of steps. Through its 
modules, Python can be used to communicate with networking devices in many ways, including SSH, NETCONF, 
and REST APIs. With so many uses, it is one of the most powerful tools a Network Programmability Ninja can have.
