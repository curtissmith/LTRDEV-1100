# Hone Your Ninja Skills

## How to Hone the Skills of the Network Programmability Ninja

To hone, or sharpen, the skills of any art, you have to practice.  Through rote repetition, you will become more 
confident in your skills.  We don't expect you to write a Python script so early down the path of the Network 
Programmability Ninja.  Instead, take the samples and examples found in this lab, DevNet, and elsewhere to build 
practice and learn.  As you use sample code, you will find you will need to modify the code to mold it into something
directly applicable to you and your environment.  Over time, you will learn by example how to start writing code on 
your own.  Do not hesitate to rest on the shoulders of others who are further down their journey and are willing to 
share with the novice. 

Now that we have introduced the essential tools of the Ninja, it is time to hone the skills of the Ninja using 
those skills, additionally armed with new concepts that we will introduce in the next section of this lab.
