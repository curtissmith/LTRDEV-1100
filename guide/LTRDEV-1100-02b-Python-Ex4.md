### Exercise 4: Working with the Python Interpreter

#### Objectives

The objectives for this exercise are to:

* Learn how to work with the Python interpreter
* Learn how to run a Python script

#### Step 1: Working with the Python Interpreter

Recall that Python is an interpreted language, meaning that every command is evaluated as it is ran. The Python 
interpreter can be ran interactively, allowing for real-time testing of code. This can be a great way to learn how a 
particular function acts, or as a quick way to execute one-time use Python code.

1.  Open the Git Bash terminal by double clicking the Git Bash icon on the desktop:

2.  Make sure that your terminal still shows the prepended project name `(pythonenv)`. If it does not, then change to
your lab working directory and activate the Python virtual environment you created earlier in this lab:
    
    ```
    $ cd ~/lab
    $ source pythonenv/Scripts/activate
    (pythonenv) $
    ```

2.  Run the interactive interpreter by issuing the `python` command in the terminal, for example:
    
    ```
    (pythonenv) $ python
    Python 3.6.5 (v3.6.5:f59c0932b4, Mar 28 2018, 16:07:46) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Inte
    l)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>
    ```

3.  Notice that once the Python interpreter is running, the prompt changes to `>>>`. This is where you can input Python 
code. Start with printing `Hello World!` to the screen, as shown below:
    
    ```
    >>> print("Hello World!")
    Hello World!
    >>>
    ```

4.  The interactive interpreter is mainly used for practicing, learning, debugging, or quick one-time use. As Python 
has many built-in math and numeric functions, it can be an easy way to do quick arithmetic. For example, calculate how 
much cash to bring for a $50 dinner, including 15% tip and 6% sales tax:

    ```
    >>> 50*(1.15+.06)
    60.5
    >>>
    ```
    
    Sometimes our on-the-fly mathematics needs are directly related to our Network Programmability Ninja skills. For 
    instance, you may need to convert DSCP values to ToS values. Converting DSCP to ToS for quality of service is
    done by bit-shifting by 2 bits to the left (padding a binary number with two 0s). Doing this on paper, you would
    typically write out the binary representation of the DSCP integer, then pad two 0s on the right side of this 
    binary string, and then mentally convert that new binary string back into an integer. Python makes quick work of 
    this:
    
    ```
    >>> 46 << 2
    184
    >>>
    ```
    
    The `<<` operator executes a left bit-shift operation on the number to the left of the operator by the number of 
    bits indicated to the right of the operator. In this example, we bit-shifted two bits to the left on DSCP 46, 
    leaving us with a ToS value of 184. 

5.  To exit the interpreter, type `quit()` or use the key-sequence `CTRL-D` and it will return you to the 
    terminal prompt, for example:
    
    ```
    >>> quit()
    (pythonenv) $
    ```

#### Step 2: Running a Python Script

While the interactive Python interpreter is useful for occasional and instructional use, the majority of work with 
Python will be done by creating and running scripts. A Python script is a set of instructions written in a language 
that the Python interpreter understands. The script is written in a text editor or IDE, and 
then run against the Python interpreter.

1.  First make sure that your terminal still shows the prepended project name `(pythonenv)`. If it does not, 
then change to your lab working directory and activate the Python virtual environment you created earlier in this 
lab, for example:
    
    ```
    $ cd ~/lab
    $ source pythonenv/Scripts/activate
    (pythonenv) $
    ```

2.  Let's create a new Python script:
    
    ```
    (pythonenv) $ echo 'print("Hello World!")' >> helloworld.py
    ```

3.  Run the Python script by running the command `python helloworld.py`, for example:
    
    ```
    (pythonenv) $ python helloworld.py
    Hello World!
    (pythonenv) $
    ```

    By putting your Python instructions into a file, it can be called at any time by the Python interpreter. This is 
    key to reusing code.
